For movement, we're going to want to have 1 character that moves based on a keyboard event.  We're going to need to make a function for hero called processEvent

going to need a switch statement 


case up_pressed:
     set ay = -ACCEL_Y
case down_pressed:
     set ay = ACCEL_Y
case left_pressed
     set ax = -ACCEL_X
case right_pressed
     set ax = ACCEL_X
case up_released
     if(ay==-ACCEL_Y)
	set ay = 0
case down_released
     if(ay==ACCEL_Y)
          set ay = 0
case left_released
     if(ax == -ACCEL_X)
     	   set ax = 0
case right_released
     if(ax == ACCEL_X)
     	   set ax = 0
default
	break;
