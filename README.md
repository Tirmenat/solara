Here's portions of brad email to Emrich
some of which we could eventually use
*/
/*   
develop a top-down scroller 
(kind of the like the original Zelda), with shooting capabilities. 
the ability to "power up" 
character's abilities change throughout the course of the game.  
robust base "unit" class that can be used for all of the objects
camera fixed on the player while he interacts with the environment.  
This will provide a smooth way of moving around, but possible stress with edge conditions
